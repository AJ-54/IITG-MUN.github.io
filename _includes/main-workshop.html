  <div class="speech-text-column"> Dear delegates,

As the Secretary-General of IIT Guwahati Model United Nations, Edition X, I couldn’t be more honoured to welcome you all on behalf of my passionate team to our most ambitious conference yet. Every year, we endeavour to provide a simulated learning platform to like-minded folks with a zealous passion for debating, international diplomacy as well as political dialogue and deliberative problem-solving. Industry, diligence and perseverance are virtues that we at the secretariat deem as cornerstones of our organization.

The contemporary world scenario has been dominated by disruptions, both positive and negative. While the former can serve as a driving force for the global growth engine, dealing with the latter requires meticulous planning and deliberation. As a proponent of this thought, we have handpicked four agendas for this winter and set the floor for discussion on the same, namely:- “Addressing power disparity in the World Trade Organisation: structural reform and policy revision”, “Secession of the UK from the European Union: trade, border policy and immigration”, ”Amendment to the transgender rights bill: empowerment, anti-discrimination and gender dysphoria”, and “Safeguarding privacy in the era of mass surveillance.”

The three days spent here will not only elevate us on a personal level but will also forge bonds and friendships that last a lifetime. So, learn, interact and join the confluence of minds that is IIT Guwahati Model United Nations.

Regards.

Tejal Agarwal
